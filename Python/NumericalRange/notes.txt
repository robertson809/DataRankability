# to finish my proof to show that the eigenvalues are real, take the matrix in frobenius
# normal form, and then look at it's imploding k complete graph sections and then its
# pointing to everything else section. One you know the form of, the other is just a upper triangularmatrix so
# you know the eignvalues are k because the diangonal lines are k
